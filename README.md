### todo

* add maybe an interface to indicate a `state` class?
* app -> refactor StatePersistence

!!when debugging you see where you have left off!!
possibility to share state across devices
possibility to store internal state (switch item/user/whatever and continue where you have left off)
ability to create hands-off experience (sharing state with diffrent platforms for example)
ui testing is easier
and general testing is easier as it's reproducible
initial app state
not much worries about lifecycle nor technology to be used (plain activities/fragments/views/whatever (what else though?)
fits better on mobile
preserved state even if app is killed

in general state handling in Adnroid is.. accidental click back and that's it, you have lost everything
phone has turned off... and you have lost everything
